Move

SList: Move Min to Front
Create a standalone function that locates the minimum value in a linked list, and moves that node to the front of the list. Return the new list, with all nodes still present, and all (except for the new head node) in their original order.

SList: Move Max to Back
Create a standalone function that locates the maximum value in a linked list, and moves that node to the back of the list. Return the new list, with all nodes still present, and all in their original order except for the node you moved to the end of the singly linked list.
